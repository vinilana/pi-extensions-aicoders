# Test Generation

## Procedure

1. Confirm the task scope and active PREVC phase.
2. Load the relevant project docs from `.context/docs/`.
3. Apply the checklist below to the specific files in scope.
4. Capture validation evidence and unresolved risks.

## Checklist

- Use repository-specific conventions, not generic defaults.
- Reference concrete files, commands and outputs.
- Keep recommendations actionable and prioritized.
- If information is missing, inspect the codebase first, then ask a focused question only when needed.

## Project Notes

- Use this skill against a pi-extension codebase with TypeScript as the primary language.
- No automated validation scripts detected; add lint/typecheck/test scripts when the project grows.
- Smoke-test extension loading with `pi -e .` in a disposable session.
- Exercise `/dotcontext init` and `/dotcontext feed <task>` against a temporary repository before release.
- Test allow/block decisions for sensitive paths and destructive commands.
- Validate PREVC stage transitions with prevc_workflow actions and command flows.

## Useful Context
