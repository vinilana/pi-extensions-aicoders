# Refactoring

## Procedure

1. Confirm the task scope and active PREVC phase.
2. Load the relevant project docs from `.context/docs/`.
3. Apply the checklist below to the specific files in scope.
4. Capture validation evidence and unresolved risks.

## Checklist

- Use repository-specific conventions, not generic defaults.
- Reference concrete files, commands and outputs.
- Keep recommendations actionable and prioritized.
- If information is missing, inspect the codebase first, then ask a focused question only when needed.

## Project Notes

- Use this skill against a pi-extension codebase with TypeScript as the primary language.
- Use pi extension entrypoints instead of forking pi internals.
- Keep .context generation repository-local and preserve manually edited context files unless --force is requested.
- Keep PREVC state and formatting separated across domain, application and adapter modules.
- Fail closed for sensitive operations when no UI confirmation is available.

## Useful Context

- `.context/docs/project-overview.md`
- `.context/docs/development-workflow.md`
- `.context/docs/architecture.md`
- `.context/docs/api.md`
- `.context/docs/data-flow.md`
- `.context/docs/getting-started.md`
